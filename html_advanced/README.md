HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage, telling browsers how to display text, images, and other multimedia elements. HTML uses a series of elements and attributes to define the structure of a document, creating a tree-like hierarchy of content. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
Markup Language:
HTML is not a programming language; instead, it's a markup language. This means it uses "tags" to label pieces of content, indicating how they should be interpreted by a web browser. 
Structure and Content:
HTML defines the fundamental structure of a webpage, including elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and more. 
Hypertext:
HTML incorporates "hypertext," which are the links that connect web pages, allowing users to navigate between different resources. 
Elements and Tags:
HTML uses elements, which are essentially instructions for the browser. Each element is defined by a starting and ending tag, like <p> and </p> for a paragraph. 
Attributes:
Elements can have attributes that provide additional information about them, such as the source of an image (<img>) or the URL of a link (<a>). 
Web Browsers:
Web browsers read HTML code and render it as a visual webpage, interpreting the tags and displaying the content accordingly. 
HTML5:
The latest version of HTML is HTML5, which includes new elements and features to support modern web development. 
Complementary Technologies:
While HTML provides the structure, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) handles the visual presentation (styling), and JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.
